IDEAS
---------

- Add size ctor
- Get rid of the default ctor ? (enforce valid init with size)
- Use exception to enforce positives
- Maybe enforce positive number by using a class, instead of an int ?
- Or maybe even better use uint as type (and check for zero ?), as "PositiveInteger" semantically includes zero (and we just don't want 0 for our domain specific problem ...)
